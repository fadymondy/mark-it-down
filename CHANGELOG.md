# Changelog

All notable changes to this extension will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — Phase 0.3: Mermaid polish (#3)

- Mermaid diagrams in View mode now have hover controls: `+` / `−` zoom, `1×` reset, and `Copy` (posts the original mermaid source via the existing clipboard channel)
- Cmd/Ctrl + scroll over a diagram zooms in/out (clamped to 0.2×–6×); click-and-drag pans
- Theme sync: when VSCode's color theme changes mid-session, `initMermaid()` re-initializes mermaid with the matching theme and every existing diagram re-renders via `rerenderMermaidForTheme()` from its stashed source
- Error UX: failed renders show a structured card with title + parser message + collapsible source instead of a blank box
- Pointer-event drag with `setPointerCapture` keeps the drag attached even if the cursor leaves the diagram bounds

### Added — Phase 0.2: Real code editor in Edit mode (#2)

- The custom editor's Edit mode now uses [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net) instead of a placeholder textarea — syntax highlighting, line numbers, multi-cursor, history (Cmd/Ctrl+Z), bracket matching, indent on input, line wrapping, default keymap (find/select-all/comment/etc.)
- Theme bridged to VSCode's active theme via `--vscode-*` CSS variables; dark themes additionally load `@codemirror/theme-one-dark` for syntax token colors
- Two-way bound to the document via `WorkspaceEdit` — undo stack and external edits both round-trip cleanly; `suppressEditorChange` flag prevents echo loops
- Mode toggle (View ↔ Edit) destroys + rebuilds the EditorView so memory is clean
- Deviation from the issue spec (Monaco): swapped to CodeMirror 6 to keep the strict CSP intact and avoid a 15MB Monaco bundle. See [docs/code-editor.md](docs/code-editor.md#why-codemirror-not-monaco) for the rationale and a path back to Monaco if desired.

### Added — Notes warehouse repo (#10)

- Configure any GitHub repo as a cloud-storage backend for your notes via `markItDown.warehouse.repo` (`owner/repo`); set the branch, subdir, transport (`gh` or `git`), and auto-push behavior independently
- Status-bar indicator on the right (`Notes synced` / `syncing…` / `behind` / `conflict` / `sync error` / `off`); click → opens the **Mark It Down: Warehouse** output channel
- Pull on activation (non-blocking); debounced auto-push on note save (default 5s, configurable 1–60s)
- Workspace notes go under `<subdir>/<workspace-slug>/`, global notes under `<subdir>/_personal/`. Same warehouse can host many workspaces side-by-side; same warehouse can serve multiple machines
- Per-scope `_index.json` mirrors the F6 NotesStore index — title / category / timestamps. Markdown content lives next to it as `<id>.md`
- First-push gate: confirmation modal listing repo, branch, subdir, workspace slug, file plan, and counts (added / updated / deleted) — must explicitly **Push** before any commit. Per-`(repo, workspaceId)` flag stored in `workspaceState`.
- Conflict detection: when both local and remote moved since the last sync, the local copy is kept and the conflict is logged + surfaced in the status bar. Never auto-merges.
- Secret-safety scanner: every `<id>.md` is scanned before push for GitHub PATs, AWS keys, OpenAI / Anthropic `sk-`, Slack `xox`, Google API keys, PEM private keys, and JWTs. Findings show a redacted preview + line number; user can Cancel or **Push anyway** for false positives.
- Commands: `markItDown.warehouse.syncNow`, `.pull`, `.openOnGitHub`, `.openLog` — surfaced in the Notes view title bar and command palette
- Transport `gh` runs `gh auth setup-git` once per repo so push uses your existing `gh auth` session — no extra credentials prompted. Transport `git` shells out to plain git with whatever credentials you already have
- Working clone lives at `${context.globalStorageUri}/warehouse/<owner>--<repo>/`; safe to delete (re-clones on next sync)
- Last-sync timestamps stored in `globalState[markItDown.warehouse.lastSyncedAt]` for conflict detection across sessions

### Added — Phase 0.7: Notes sidebar (#7)

- Activity-bar view container "Mark It Down" with a dedicated "Notes" tree view
- Notes are grouped by **Scope** (Workspace / Global) → **Category** → **Note**
- Workspace notes live in `context.storageUri`; global notes live in `context.globalStorageUri`. Tree falls back to global-only when no folder is open.
- Note content is a real `.md` file on disk, opened through the existing Mark It Down custom editor — no separate edit surface
- Commands: `markItDown.notes.create`, `.open`, `.rename`, `.move` (between categories), `.delete`, `.refresh`, `.revealStorage`
- Inline tree actions: rename + delete on hover; "+" on scope/category rows for quick-create in context
- View title bar: New Note · Refresh · Reveal Notes Folder
- Welcome view (empty state) with a one-click "New Note" prompt
- Configuration: `markItDown.notes.categories` (default: Daily / Reference / Snippet / Drafts), `.defaultCategory`, `.defaultScope`
- Saving a note (Cmd+S in the custom editor) bumps its `updatedAt` and re-sorts the tree most-recent-first

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added — Initial scaffold + Phase 0.1

- VSCode extension scaffold (TypeScript strict, esbuild for webview)
- Custom Text Editor provider (`markItDown.editor`) registered for `*.md`, `*.mdx`, `*.markdown`
- Read-only markdown rendering via marked + marked-highlight + highlight.js
- Mermaid live rendering for ` ```mermaid ` code blocks (theme-aware, light/dark)
- DOMPurify sanitization of rendered HTML
- Inline textarea editor (Phase 0.2 will replace with Monaco)
- Toggle command: View ↔ Edit
- Stub commands: Export PDF / DOCX / TXT (file-level + explorer context menu)
- VSCode theme bridge — uses `--vscode-*` CSS variables so the renderer matches the active theme
- External link handling — `https://` links open in OS browser
- Code-block per-block "Copy" action (hover-revealed)
- Configuration: `markItDown.theme`, `markItDown.startMode`, `markItDown.mermaid.enabled`
- `.github/` scaffolding: FUNDING, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, bug + feature issue templates
